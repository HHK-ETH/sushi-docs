# BentoBox SDK

The BentoBox SDK is our smallest package, due to the majority of the functionality being housed in the smart contracts. There are only two function contained in it, both helper functions:

- `toAmount()` takes the underlying `bento` shares and converts them into token amounts

- `toShare()` takes the underlying token amounts and converts them into `bento` shares

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/sushiswap/sdk/tree/canary/packages/bentobox-sdk).
